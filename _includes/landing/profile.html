            My name is Mel, and I am a qualified practitioner with post-graduate
            level training and professional registration. My therapeutic
            practice developed after working for over twenty years in education,
            with over ten years as a specialist SEND teacher. I work
            holistically with the child at the centre, in a way that is both
            permissive and develops a sense of responsibility. I have a deep
            understanding of child development and am both attachment &
            trauma-informed. I have a specific interest in neurodiversity and
            have worked with Autistic children and their families for over ten
            years. Play Therapy offers expression through play and unconditional
            acceptance of all brain functions and is therefore inherently
            neuro-affirming.
